# Wit.AI API Tester

#### Easily test [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/) API request

When I started exploring [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/), first problem i encountered was testing of request. For each new
request i need to create curl request from Settings tab & then hit that curl request from console. To overcome this I
have created simple HTML/JavaScript app with which you can easily test your requests.

### Setup Guide

1. Clone project.
2. Update access_token on main.js (Use Server Access Token from Settings/App Details)
3. Done! Just run index.html on browser.
