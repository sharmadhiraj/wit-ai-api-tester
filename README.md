## Wit.AI API Tester

### Easily Test Wit.AI API Requests

When exploring [Wit.AI](https://wit.ai/), I encountered the challenge of testing requests. Each new request required creating a curl request from the Settings tab and then executing it from the console. To address this, I created a simple HTML/JavaScript app that allows easy testing of requests.

### Setup Guide

1. Clone the project.
2. Update the access token in `main.js` (Use the Server Access Token from Settings/App Details).
3. That's it! Simply run `index.html` in your browser.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions.
